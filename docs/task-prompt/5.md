TASK: Portfolio Projects Section (Client Projects Showcase)

You are working under the following system constraints:

- React / Next.js frontend only
- MUI (Material UI)
- Atomic Design methodology
- No new dependencies
- No backend logic
- Workspace-write mode
- No network access

GOAL:
Design and specify a Projects section that showcases selected client projects,
with a list of project names and a visual preview panel, inspired by the reference design.

REQUIRED STEPS (DO NOT SKIP):

1. Create folder:
   docs/ui/portfolio-projects-section/

2. Create `contract.md` using the frontend contract template.

3. Create `tracking.md` with:

   - checklist
   - phased implementation plan

4. Analyze the Projects section requirements:

   - Section heading and short description
   - List of project names (selectable)
   - Active project state
   - Preview panel that updates based on selected project

5. Propose EXACTLY 3 UI / architecture approaches:

   - Each approach must describe:
     - State management strategy (local UI state only)
     - Atomic component breakdown
     - Layout behavior across breakpoints
     - How preview switching is handled

6. STOP after presenting the 3 approaches.
   DO NOT implement any React components yet.

SCOPE:

- Projects section only
- Static mock project data
- Interactive selection state (UI only)

OUT OF SCOPE:

- Routing to project pages
- Animations
- Data fetching

ATOMIC DESIGN GUIDANCE:

- Atoms: Typography, Divider
- Molecules: ProjectListItem
- Organisms: ProjectsList, ProjectPreview
- Templates: SectionWrapper

EDGE CASES TO CONSIDER:

- No project selected (default state)
- Very long project titles
- Preview image missing
- Small screen behavior (stacked layout)

AFTER COMPLETION:
Ask the user:
"What did I miss?"
