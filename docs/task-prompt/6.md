TASK: Portfolio Designs Carousel (Creative Works Slider)

You are working under the following system constraints:

- React / Next.js frontend only
- MUI (Material UI)
- Atomic Design methodology
- No new dependencies
- No backend logic
- Workspace-write mode
- No network access

GOAL:
Design and specify a horizontal carousel / slider section that showcases creative
design works, inspired by the reference portfolio design.

REQUIRED STEPS (DO NOT SKIP):

1. Create folder:
   docs/ui/portfolio-designs-carousel/

2. Create `contract.md` using the frontend contract template.

3. Create `tracking.md` with:

   - checklist
   - phased implementation plan

4. Analyze the Designs Carousel requirements:

   - Section title
   - Horizontal list of design cards
   - Navigation controls (previous / next)
   - Visible active index indicator (e.g. "1 / 5")

5. Propose EXACTLY 3 implementation approaches:

   - Each approach must include:
     - Carousel logic strategy (CSS vs JS)
     - Atomic component breakdown
     - Accessibility considerations
     - Mobile interaction behavior (swipe / buttons)

6. STOP after presenting the 3 approaches.
   DO NOT implement any React components yet.

SCOPE:

- Designs carousel section only
- Static mock design data
- Client-side UI logic only

OUT OF SCOPE:

- Auto-play
- Touch gesture libraries
- External carousel dependencies

ATOMIC DESIGN GUIDANCE:

- Atoms: IconButton, Typography
- Molecules: DesignCard
- Organisms: CarouselControls, DesignsCarousel
- Templates: SectionWrapper

EDGE CASES TO CONSIDER:

- Fewer than 3 items
- Very wide images
- Small screen horizontal overflow
- Disabled navigation states

AFTER COMPLETION:
Ask the user:
"What did I miss?"
