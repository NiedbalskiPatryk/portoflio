TASK: Portfolio Contact Section (Get in Touch)

You are working under the following system constraints:

- React / Next.js frontend only
- MUI (Material UI)
- Atomic Design methodology
- No new dependencies
- No backend logic
- Workspace-write mode
- No network access

GOAL:
Design and specify a Contact section that allows users to send a message
and view basic contact information, inspired by the reference design.

REQUIRED STEPS (DO NOT SKIP):

1. Create folder:
   docs/ui/portfolio-contact-section/

2. Create `contract.md` using the frontend contract template.

3. Create `tracking.md` with:

   - checklist
   - phased implementation plan

4. Analyze the Contact section requirements:

   - Section heading and short description
   - Contact form fields:
     - Full name
     - Email address
     - Phone number
     - Subject
     - Message
   - Submit button with disabled / loading UI states
   - Static contact information (email, phone)

5. Propose EXACTLY 3 UI / architecture approaches:

   - Each approach must describe:
     - Form layout strategy
     - Validation UI (visual only)
     - Atomic component breakdown
     - Responsive behavior

6. STOP after presenting the 3 approaches.
   DO NOT implement any React components yet.

SCOPE:

- Contact section UI only
- Mock form behavior (no submission)
- Client-side state only

OUT OF SCOPE:

- Actual form submission
- Backend / API calls
- CAPTCHA or spam protection

ATOMIC DESIGN GUIDANCE:

- Atoms: TextField, Button, Typography
- Molecules: FormRow, ContactInfoItem
- Organisms: ContactForm, ContactInfo
- Templates: SectionWrapper

EDGE CASES TO CONSIDER:

- Invalid email format (UI only)
- Very long messages
- Small screen keyboard overlap
- Disabled submit state

AFTER COMPLETION:
Ask the user:
"What did I miss?"
