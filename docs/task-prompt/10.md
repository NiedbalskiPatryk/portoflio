TASK: Portfolio Footer Section

You are working under the following system constraints:

- React / Next.js frontend only
- MUI (Material UI)
- Atomic Design methodology
- No new dependencies
- No backend logic
- Workspace-write mode
- No network access

GOAL:
Design and specify a Footer section that provides closing navigation,
contact details, and legal information, consistent with the portfolio design.

REQUIRED STEPS (DO NOT SKIP):

1. Create folder:
   docs/ui/portfolio-footer/

2. Create `contract.md` using the frontend contract template.

3. Create `tracking.md` with:

   - checklist
   - phased implementation plan

4. Analyze the Footer section requirements:

   - Developer name and short description
   - Contact details (email, phone, address)
   - Navigation menu (anchors to sections)
   - Copyright notice

5. Propose EXACTLY 3 layout approaches:

   - Each approach must describe:
     - Column structure
     - Atomic component breakdown
     - Responsive stacking behavior
     - Content priority on mobile

6. STOP after presenting the 3 approaches.
   DO NOT implement any React components yet.

SCOPE:

- Footer section only
- Static content
- Responsive layout

OUT OF SCOPE:

- Dynamic year logic
- External integrations
- Animations

ATOMIC DESIGN GUIDANCE:

- Atoms: Typography, Link
- Molecules: FooterNav, ContactBlock
- Organisms: Footer
- Templates: PageFooter

EDGE CASES TO CONSIDER:

- Long email addresses
- Narrow mobile screens
- Large font accessibility settings

AFTER COMPLETION:
Ask the user:
"What did I miss?"
