TASK: Portfolio Layout Shell (Header, Navigation, Page Container)

You are working under the following system constraints:

- React / Next.js frontend only
- MUI (Material UI)
- Atomic Design methodology
- No new dependencies
- No backend logic
- Workspace-write mode
- No network access

GOAL:
Prepare the global layout shell for a portfolio website inspired by a dark, minimal developer portfolio design.

This task covers ONLY the structural layout and navigation.
Do NOT implement hero, services, projects, or any content sections.

REQUIRED STEPS (DO NOT SKIP):

1. Create folder:
   docs/ui/portfolio-layout-shell/

2. Create `contract.md` using the provided frontend contract template.

3. Create `tracking.md` and initialize:

   - task checklist
   - step-by-step progress tracking

4. Analyze the layout requirements and propose EXACTLY 3 approaches:

   - Each approach must include:
     - Component structure (Atomic Design levels)
     - Layout strategy
     - Pros
     - Cons
     - UI / UX edge cases (especially mobile)

5. STOP after presenting the 3 approaches.
   DO NOT write or modify any React code yet.

SCOPE:

- Top navigation / header
- Page max-width container
- Vertical section spacing
- Scroll-based navigation (anchors, not routing)

OUT OF SCOPE:

- Hero content
- Section UI
- Animations
- Theme definition

ATOMIC DESIGN GUIDANCE:

- Atoms: LogoText, NavLink, IconButton
- Molecules: NavigationMenu
- Organisms: Header
- Templates: PortfolioLayout

AFTER COMPLETION:
Ask the user:
"What did I miss?"
