TASK: Portfolio Services Section

You are working under the following system constraints:

- React / Next.js frontend only
- MUI (Material UI)
- Atomic Design methodology
- No new dependencies
- No backend logic
- Workspace-write mode
- No network access

GOAL:
Design and specify a Services section presenting offered competencies in a clean,
card-based layout inspired by the reference portfolio design.

REQUIRED STEPS (DO NOT SKIP):

1. Create folder:
   docs/ui/portfolio-services-section/

2. Create `contract.md` using the frontend contract template.

3. Create `tracking.md` with:

   - checklist
   - implementation steps

4. Analyze the Services section requirements:

   - Section heading and description
   - 4 service items:
     - Front-End Development
     - Back-End Development
     - UI / UX Design
     - Performance Optimization

5. Propose EXACTLY 3 layout/component approaches:

   - Each approach must include:
     - Atomic breakdown
     - Grid behavior (desktop / tablet / mobile)
     - Icon usage strategy
     - Content scalability

6. STOP after presenting the 3 approaches.
   DO NOT implement any React components yet.

SCOPE:

- Services section only
- Static mock data
- Responsive grid layout

OUT OF SCOPE:

- Animations
- Navigation
- Projects or other sections

ATOMIC DESIGN GUIDANCE:

- Atoms: Icon, Typography
- Molecules: ServiceCard
- Organisms: ServicesGrid
- Templates: SectionWrapper

EDGE CASES TO CONSIDER:

- Long service descriptions
- Uneven card heights
- Single-column mobile layout

AFTER COMPLETION:
Ask the user:
"What did I miss?"
