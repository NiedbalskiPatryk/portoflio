TASK: Portfolio FAQ Section (Frequently Asked Questions)

You are working under the following system constraints:

- React / Next.js frontend only
- MUI (Material UI)
- Atomic Design methodology
- No new dependencies
- No backend logic
- Workspace-write mode
- No network access

GOAL:
Design and specify an FAQ section that presents common questions and answers
in a clean, accessible, accordion-based layout inspired by the reference design.

REQUIRED STEPS (DO NOT SKIP):

1. Create folder:
   docs/ui/portfolio-faq-section/

2. Create `contract.md` using the frontend contract template.

3. Create `tracking.md` with:

   - checklist
   - phased implementation plan

4. Analyze the FAQ section requirements:

   - Section title
   - List of question/answer items
   - Expand/collapse interaction
   - Keyboard and accessibility behavior

5. Propose EXACTLY 3 UI / architecture approaches:

   - Each approach must describe:
     - Accordion behavior (single vs multiple open)
     - Atomic component breakdown
     - Accessibility considerations
     - Responsive behavior

6. STOP after presenting the 3 approaches.
   DO NOT implement any React components yet.

SCOPE:

- FAQ section only
- Static mock FAQ data
- Client-side UI logic only

OUT OF SCOPE:

- Search or filtering
- Animations
- Backend integration

ATOMIC DESIGN GUIDANCE:

- Atoms: Typography, Icon
- Molecules: FAQItem
- Organisms: FAQList
- Templates: SectionWrapper

EDGE CASES TO CONSIDER:

- Very long questions
- Very long answers
- All items collapsed
- Multiple items expanded on mobile

AFTER COMPLETION:
Ask the user:
"What did I miss?"
