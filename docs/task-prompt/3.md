TASK: Portfolio Hero Section (Above-the-Fold)

You are working under the following system constraints:

- React / Next.js frontend only
- MUI (Material UI)
- Atomic Design methodology
- No new dependencies
- No backend logic
- Workspace-write mode
- No network access

GOAL:
Design and specify the Hero section of a developer portfolio homepage.
This is the first visible section and must clearly communicate identity and value.

REQUIRED STEPS (DO NOT SKIP):

1. Create folder:
   docs/ui/portfolio-hero-section/

2. Create `contract.md` using the frontend contract template.

3. Create `tracking.md` with:

   - checklist
   - phased implementation plan

4. Analyze the Hero section based on the reference design:

   - Location label
   - Name + role headline
   - Short description
   - Primary + secondary CTA buttons
   - Technology stack list

5. Propose EXACTLY 3 UI/architecture approaches:

   - Each approach must describe:
     - Atomic component breakdown
     - Layout behavior per breakpoint
     - CTA behavior on mobile
     - Text overflow handling

6. STOP after presenting the 3 approaches.
   DO NOT implement any components yet.

SCOPE:

- Hero section only
- Mock content only
- Responsive layout (mobile-first)

OUT OF SCOPE:

- Animations
- Theme setup
- Navigation
- Backend or form logic

ATOMIC DESIGN GUIDANCE:

- Atoms: Button, Typography, Icon, Chip
- Molecules: CTAGroup, TechStackRow
- Organisms: HeroSection
- Templates: HomePageSection wrapper

EDGE CASES TO CONSIDER:

- Very long names or titles
- Small mobile screens
- Many technology tags

AFTER COMPLETION:
Ask the user:
"What did I miss?"
